I am a graduate student in the Digital Agriculture Lab in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering. My research motivation is to bring the next generation of agricultural decision support using data-validated models aided through remote sensing and artificial intelligence. Film photography is my creative outlet and road cycling slows down the pace of life.
