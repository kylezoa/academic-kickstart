# Research usage

* Simulate the precipitation-reducing effect that climate change may cause in the Sierra Foothills and quantify the change in forage yield

# Personal involvement

* Research prior rainout shelter designs for automated movement method
* Design a tracked wheel assembly that prevents lift-up in windy conditions using Solidworks
* Design a rack-and-pinion style, electric drivetrain to move rainout shelter up and down a slope with chain and wire cable
* Program a Campbell Scientific datalogger (CR300) to trigger a subroutine in a separate, primary PLC during precipitation event
* Program a primary/secondary PLC network over 4-20mA analog signal to issue deploy/retract commands to an array of 16 rainout shelters
* Program secondary PLC logic for safe deployment of rainout shelter
* Plan radio network for remote data collection and datalogger control over hilly terrain using LOGGERNET
* Suggest best practices for integration of hydraulic motor and PLC automation
* Order building material from local vendors
