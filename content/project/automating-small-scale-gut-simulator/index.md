# Research goal
Increase throughput of gastric experiments through multiple, down-scaled gastric modules to enable greater repetitions of treatments.

# Personal involvement
* Program Arduino control of,
  * motor operation
  * temperature control
  * pH monitoring
  * safety watchdog
* Integrate 2X16 LED screen, numeric touchpad, and emergency stop button for operator control of Arduino program
* Wire all electrical components together
* Coordinate with campus safety services to identify operational hazards and train operators to reduce risk during operation
